description: Deconstruct a body of text, replacing words with the parsed form of their longest synonym to make anything sound smarter. We use natural language processing libraries to perform part-of-speech tagging and to convert a word to its base form. Then we use a thesaurus API to find the longest word that still means pretty much the same thing, and another natural language library to decline/conjugate/whatever the new word's base form into the original word's original form.
