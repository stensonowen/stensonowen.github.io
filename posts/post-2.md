# TITLE 1
## TITLE 2
### TITLE 3

* foo

*this is in italic*  and _so is this_

**this is in bold**  and __so is this__

***this is bold and italic***  and ___so is this___

> Use it if you're quoting a person, a song or whatever.

> You can use *italic* or lists inside them also.
And just like with other paragraphs,
all of these lines are still
part of the blockquote, even without the > character in front.

To end the blockquote, just put a blank line before the following
paragraph.


    :::python
    import abc
    s = rand()[:2]

    :::python
    import abc
